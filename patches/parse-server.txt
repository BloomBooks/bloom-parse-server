RestQuery.js:
In parse-server 5.2.5, they made a security "fix" to prevent searching on user email (among other fields).
See https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/blob/6.0.0/changelogs/CHANGELOG_release.md#525-2022-09-02.
We decided to just allow this "security hole," thus I've made the simplest change to prevent the check, commenting two lines.

Maybe some day parse-server will allow for this to be configurable. Or maybe we will even submit a PR.


middlewares.js:
After upgrading to parse-server 7, we started getting an error when it tried to validate the master key because it was
getting undefined for the clientIp. I ended up just working around this by making it accept anything, even undefined,
if the master key was open to all IP addresses.
